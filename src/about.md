The person
---

My name is Harold Khen Daniel Baniqued. You can call me either Harold or Khen. I'm a Software Engineer from Philippines, currently working at [BlastAsia Inc](https://blastasia.com). I dabble around with mostly front-end technologies, always keep up-to-date with the latest products, constantly learning new things and never stop building useful applications for myself and other people.

I've been a developer for almost 2 years now. I'm still learning everything and gaining experience. I'm also an aspiring photographer but I haven't really have the chance to create my portfolio, maybe someday. I also do freelancing [projects](https://https://github.com/thekhenzie/veneracions-resort). I usually spend my free time on [various little projects](https://github.com/thekhenzie). I also browse articles on the Net; mainly on [Reddit](https://reddit.com), [Quora](https://quora.com), and [Free Code Camp](https://medium.freecodecamp.org).   

Here, have a peek at my [résumé](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/7EYRcCls0pSfVv). You can also find me on [Facebook](https://fb.me/haroldbaniqued), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/khndii), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/kingkheeen/), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harold-khen-baniqued-b2422a125/). [Email](mailto:thekhenzie@gmail.com) me for more enquiries.
