Christmas Season 
===

"*Uy ber na*"

"*Whenever I see boys and girls..*"


Here in Philippines, Christmas season starts as early as September. The term "*ber [months] na*" actually means the we're already on the months ending with -ber, eg. September, October, November, December. Christmas countdowns are everywhere. Christmas decorations are also discounted now. My Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU0rV6Im72pA?si=9QmiW67IQeuyONbYF7vVBw) too is full of Christmas songs.


Aside from those, [Jose Mari Chan](http://josemarichan.com/) memes are also everywhere. By the way, Jose Mari Chan is one of the popular singer here in the Philippines. Some of his hits were Christmas songs, especially [Perfect Christmas](https://open.spotify.com/track/6nCAuV8db9kn8S3TOlp5BA?si=NtO3TDqlQ4GuuVBB0-ax5w), and [Christmas in our Hearts](https://open.spotify.com/track/1L9LqXxv9D3BV9g4fWIkWL?si=xByXOEn0TQC-ir0MDvBcJg).

Well, I wrote this because I'm litle too excited for Christmas. Why? Because it's the birth of Jesus Christ; and then a day after, the birth of me.
