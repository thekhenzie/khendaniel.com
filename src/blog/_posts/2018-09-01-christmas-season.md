Christmas Season 
===

"*Uy ber na*"

"*Whenever I see boys and girls..*"


Here in Philippines, Christmas season starts as early as September. The term "*ber [months] na *" actually means the we're already on the months ending with -ber, eg. September, October, November, December. Christmas countdown already started. Christmas decorations are discounted now. My Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU0rV6Im72pA?si=9QmiW67IQeuyONbYF7vVBw)  is full of Christmas songs too.


Aside from those, [Jose Mari Chan](http://josemarichan.com/) memes are also everywhere. By the way, Jose Mari Chan, the voice of Christmas, is one of the popular singer here in the Philippines. Some of his hits were Christmas songs, especially [Perfect Christmas](https://open.spotify.com/track/6nCAuV8db9kn8S3TOlp5BA?si=NtO3TDqlQ4GuuVBB0-ax5w), and [Christmas in our Hearts](https://open.spotify.com/track/1L9LqXxv9D3BV9g4fWIkWL?si=xByXOEn0TQC-ir0MDvBcJg). Memes aside, he deserved all the love that he gets.

Well, I wrote this because I'm litle too excited for Christmas. Giving gifts, not to your loved ones only, but to others that can't afford it. I also love the idea walking down to our street seeing many Christmas [parols](https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.UCLE6-oyQJAq0PnFtfxhEQHaFg). You will also hear group of children carol from home to home singing "*[Sa may bahay ang aming bati](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT2d4CQHDBw)*". The day after Christmas is the day I was born.


Ofcourse, let us not forget that it's the celebration of birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
