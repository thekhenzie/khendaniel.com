Obligatory "Hello World"

**Hello World!**

*This should have been my first blog post, but nevermind.*

I have never been much of a blogger before but now that I have moved on to a new adventure, I will be making efforts to blog my progress, challenges, and learning to code. 

While I'm not a total newbie when it comes to code, I have just recently began devoting my free time to learning and commiting my progress to [Github](https://github.com). The projects I've been working on recently was mostly consist of tutorials and a few personal project including this blog.

Also, I'm now starting to create my photography portfolio. You can peak at it [here](https://photography.khendaniel.com), and [here](https://twitter.com/khndii/status/1037988540066422784). If I'm not that busy, I might create a new blog about it.
