Building in action

Since Monday, I'm working on my blogsite. At first, I don't know how since I'm new to it. I've found several tutorials about creating blogsites using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosting it through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Luckily, I found this [blogsite](http://blakeembrey.com/articles/2014/09/building-a-blog-with-metalsmith/) which uses [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io) as the framework for my blog. 

After tinkering and experimenting, I immediately host it to GithubPages. I also use a custom domain bought at [GoDaddy](http://godaddy.com) for just a dollar. Actually, I have used Github pages before. So while I'm busy creating my blogsite, I hosted a coming soon page like [this](https://themeforest.net/item/cryptosoon-coming-soon-template/21654433). 

Its kinda funny because I set my deadline before September ends, but I actually finished it by the end of August.
