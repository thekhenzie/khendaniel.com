The Introduction
===

I've been slacking this whole year and always thinking that I'm not productive enough. I don't want to end my year like that. With that in mind, I want to try something new. I decided to create a blog that will tell my everyday story. I also want to try this before but I haven't worked on it until now. 

Well, the fact is I want to experience the wonderful world of blogging. From today onwards, I'm officially declaring myself a blogger!
